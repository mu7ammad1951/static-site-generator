# Static Site Generator

This is a static site generator built using python. It converts '.md' files to '.html' allowing the proper viewing of markdown files in your browser.

You can clone this project using git using `git clone https://github.com/mu7ammad1951/static-site-generator` or `git clone git@github.com:mu7ammad1951/static-site-generator` for HTTPS or SSH respectively

To adjust the styling, edit the 'index.css' file located in the 'static' directory. All images are stored in the 'static/images' directory.

To use this generator, place your own markdown files in the content directory. You can structure then inside the content directory as you like. Ensure your markdown files are appropriately formmatted with an empty line separating each block. Analyze the existing markdown files in the 'content' directory to understand the proper formatting.

To run the files on Linux, you can use the pre-written script main.sh
`./main.sh` will run and also start an http server on port 8888
